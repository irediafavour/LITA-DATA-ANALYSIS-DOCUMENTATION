### Project Overview
This project aims to show the complete data analysis process, starting with collecting and organizing data in Microsoft Excel, moving on to using SQL for data manipulation and queries, and ending with creating interactive dashboards in Power BI. The aim is to provide useful insights for better decision-making.

### Data Source
The main dataset utilized in this project is "Data Sale.csv," an open-source file that can be freely accessed and downloaded from platforms like Kaggle or other data repository websites.

### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://wwww.microsoft.com)
  1. For data cleaning
  2. For data organization
  3. For data analysis
  
 - SOL
   1. For data manipulation
