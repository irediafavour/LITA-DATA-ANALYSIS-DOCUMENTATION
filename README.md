### Project Topic:  Data Analytics Journey: From Excel Spreadsheets to Power BI Dashboards

### Project Overview
This project aims to show the complete data analysis process, starting with collecting and organizing data in Microsoft Excel, moving on to using SQL for data manipulation and queries, and ending with creating interactive dashboards in Power BI. The aim is to provide useful insights for better decision-making.

### Data Source
The main dataset utilized in this project is "Data Sale.csv," an open-source file that can be freely accessed and downloaded from platforms like Kaggle or other data repository websites.

### Tools Used

  1. For data cleaning
  2. For data organization
  3. For data analysis
  
 - SOL
   1. For data manipulation
   2. For querying from databases

 - Power BI
   1. For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards

  - GitHub
    1. For portfolio building

### Data Cleaning
This involves the following action
1. Correcting errors
2. Removing duplicates
3. Handling missing variables

### Data Organization
This involves the following action
1. Structuring data into tables
  - semi-structured data
  - unstructured data
  - structured data
2. Sorting it by relevant criteria

### Data Analysis
This involves examining and interpreting data to uncover insights and patterns. Key techniques include:
1. Formulas and Functions: Using built-in functions like SUM, AVERAGE, VLOOKUP, and IF to perform calculations and analyze data.
   
3. Pivot Tables: Summarizing and grouping large datasets to extract meaningful information.
4. Charts and Graphs: Creating visual representations of data to highlight trends and comparisons.
5. Conditional Formatting: Highlighting specific data points or patterns using colour coding.
6. Data Filtering and Sorting: Organizing data to focus on specific subsets or criteria
